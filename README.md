This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

This project was built in order to get my hands on some of the modern React technology such as Hooks.
I also took the opportunity to learn Typescript together with this app.


## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### To be continued

- adding layouts and proper buttons
